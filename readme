# Analysis of EV Adoption Influences

## Project Overview
This project explores how media sentiment and economic factors influence electric vehicle (EV) adoption rates in the United States, with a special emphasis on geographic and economic equity. Through a combination of quantitative sentiment analysis and qualitative content analysis, alongside economic data integration, this research aims to uncover patterns and insights that could inform strategies to promote equitable EV adoption.

## Objectives
- To quantify media sentiment towards EVs and examine its correlation with EV adoption rates.
- To assess the impact of economic factors, such as EV manufacturer stock performance and fuel prices, on EV adoption.
- To explore geographic and economic disparities in EV adoption, identifying areas where policy interventions could enhance equity.

## Methodology
The project employs a mixed-methods approach:
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Sentiment analysis on media articles using NLP techniques, correlation analysis between economic indicators and EV adoption rates.
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Manual content analysis of media articles to understand framing and narrative themes.
- **Data Sources**: Includes news APIs (e.g., GDELT, NewsAPI), economic data from Yahoo Finance and FRED, EV adoption statistics from the Department of Energy, and demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

## Data Sources
- **Media Coverage Data**: Collected from various news APIs.
- **Economic Data**: Stock prices from Yahoo Finance; economic indicators from FRED.
- **EV Adoption Data**: Publicly available datasets from the Department of Energy.
